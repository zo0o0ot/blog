Indiana are the national champs! Who had THAT on their bingo card two years ago? Anyway, here are the latest draft prospect rankings.

<!--more-->

The last deadline for players to declare for the draft is January 23, so it's possible that we're going to start seeing less fluctuation in the names we see discussed.

These are interactive charts visualizing 2026 NFL Draft prospect data. Hover over chart segments to see detailed information.

## Player Value by School

This chart shows individual players as segments within each school's bar. Each segment represents one player, and you can hover to see player details.

## Methodology

The rough methodology used for the Leagify charts is this: Each prospect is given a point value based on their current rank, which is given regardless of position ("Big Board" style).

**Rank values:**

* 01 - 10   : 35 points
* 11 - 25   : 30 points
* 26 - 35   : 25 points
* 36 - 59   : 20 points
* 60 - 70   : 15 points
* 71 - 100  : 10 points
* 101 - 120 : 8 points
* 121 - 150 : 7 points
* 151 - 180 : 6 points
* 181 - 250 : 5 points
* 251 - 300 : 2 points
* 301 - 500 : 1 point

These big board rankings came from [NFL Mock Draft Database 2026 Consensus Big Board](https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/big-boards/2026/consensus-big-board-2026), which started posting 2026 prospect information quite a while ago. The earliest ranks for this draft class were from September 2024, and the most current rankings are from January 21, 2026. Only the value of the player's primary position was considered.

The data is scraped, cleaned, and mushed together with a variety of code, which is available [here](https://github.com/Leagify/prospect-scraper-mddb-2022) for viewing, if you're into that sort of thing.
